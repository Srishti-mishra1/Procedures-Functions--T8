# Procedures-Functions--T8
We create procedure and functions so that we can reuse that piece of code.I created an employee table under the functions schema. Then created procedure to calculate the increased salary. We then used the function and for the last step I applied the condition that the increased salary would be the only one to be displayed.
Stored Procedures execute SQL operations (like INSERT, UPDATE) but don't return values.

Functions return a single value (like a calculation) and can be used directly in queries.
